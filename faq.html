    <summary>How much do these cost?</summary>
    <p> As part of our goal to make prosthetics accessible to everyone, we print prosthetics free of charge for those in need. </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>How do I get one?</summary>
    <p> We will gladly print a prosthetic for you! Please send us an email:</p>
    <address>
        <a href="mailto:tritonprosthetics@gmail.com">tritonprosthetics@gmail.com</a> 
    </address>
    <p> Also note that we will ask you to come in for a fitting so we can determine what the prosthetic's dimensions should be. </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>I can't be at the campus in person, can you ship one out to me?</summary>
    <p>
        For those of you who are in the San Diego area, contact us and we'll try to get to <i>you</i>. 
        For those of you who are further out, you might have some more success with <a href='https://enablingthefuture.org/e-nable-community-chapters/'>the other e-NABLE chapters</a>. 
        If none of these options work for you, get in touch anyways! 
        We might be able to work something out.
    </p>

<details>
    <summary>What should I expect if I'm getting one?</summary>
    <p>
        We'll meet you for an hour or two to take measurements so that we know how big the prosthetic needs to be.
        Following that, it usually takes us several days to print the parts, sand them down for comfort's sake, and then assemble them into a functioning arm.
        We'll contact you once we're done, so that you can take home the arm. Along with the device itself, we'll equip you with some spare parts and show you how to conduct repairs if they are needed.
    </p>

    <summary>What can these prosthetics do, and what are their limitations?</summary>
    <p> The limitations and capabilities of these prosthetics depends largely on their build and design. If you'd like to see a detailed discussion of the designs and their capabilities, you can visit our <a href="designs.html">designs page!</a> </p>

    <summary>I'd like to lend a hand. How do I get involved?</summary>
    <p>
        If you're a student, we really appreciate donating your printing time through the Digital Media Lab. Let us know what time you can make and we'll coordinate with you!
        If you'd like to get involved with any of the design or fitting processes, please apply through our recruitment forms!
        They're posted in the UCSD Facebook groups on a regular basis.
