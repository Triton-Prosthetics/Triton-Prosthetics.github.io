<h1> Mission Statement: </h1>
<p>
    Founded in 2017, Triton Prosthetics launched with a mission to increase independence and mobility for those with amputations or limb differences through research and development of low cost, accessible prosthetics.
    Being the only organization with an e-NABLE charter certification in the greater San Diego area, TP maintains a credible reputation in the ability to create a 3-D printed product.
    Through this opportunity, TP can produce prosthetic limbs that can be easily fixed, replaced, and, most importantly, customized without a cost concern.
    This attracts individuals of younger ages, who are discouraged to make an investment of an high-end prosthetics due to physical growth, which can demand $5,000 to $50,000.

    There are a couple of problems we'd like to solve in the field of accessible prosthetics: 
    e-NABLE is low cost, but also a one-size fits all solution, which means it comes with limitations in durability and functionality.
    For example, the design uses fishing line and dental floss (for tension) which dries up and breaks easily.
    Furthermore, a wearer needs to be flexing constantly to have the hand grip an object, causing fatigue and discomfort with long-term use.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>To deal with fatigue, we’re building a myoelectric module - a small system that will allow wearers to flex to toggle the hand’s grasp.</li>
    <li>To make the arm more durable and capable, we’re coming up with our own design that will use a more durable material to deliver tension to the hand.</li>
</ul>
